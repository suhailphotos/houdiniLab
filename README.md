Welcome to **houdiniLab**, a dedicated space for experimenting and developing new tools and utilities for Houdini. This repository serves as a sandbox for testing innovative ideas and refining scripts before they are integrated into the main public repository, **houdiniUtils**.

## Purpose

The primary goal of **houdiniLab** is to provide a flexible environment for research and development (R&D) in Houdini. It is designed to streamline the creation and enhancement of Houdini workflows by allowing for the experimentation and testing of new concepts, scripts, and tools.

## Features

- **Experimental Tools**: Develop and test new tools that enhance Houdini's capabilities.
- **Script Refinement**: Refine and optimize scripts before they are moved to the main repository.
- **Workflow Enhancements**: Innovate and improve existing workflows to increase efficiency and productivity.
- **R&D Environment**: A sandbox environment where you can freely experiment without affecting the stability of the main repository.

## Structure

The repository is organized to facilitate easy navigation and collaboration. Below is the basic structure:

```
